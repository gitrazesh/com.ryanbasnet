`BUGFIX: Clear opcode cache before compiling proxy classes <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/361>`_

`TASK: Allow wildcard propertymapping configuration to set defaults for trustedProperties configuration <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/333>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before, when specifying a PropertyMappingConfiguration with a wildcard inside the initializeAction() of
a controller, this configuration would not be taken into account when a Fluid form was submitted, that
set configuration for specific properties.

This change makes the trustedProperties configuration happen *after* the user configuration, which in turn
will lead to trustedProperties always only extend the user configuration and wildcard configurations to
be used as the template configuration for the following specific trustedProperties configurations.

`BUGFIX: Fallback if custom exception rendering fails <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/354>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a custom exception rendering fails, the exception would not be
caught and thus difficult to debug. Instead as a fallback exceptions
thrown during rendering will be rendered statically.
